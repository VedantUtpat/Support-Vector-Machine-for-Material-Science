# Support-Vector-Machine-for-Material-Science
Mechanical properties of Cast Aluminum alloys  are predicted with the help of Support Vector Machine (SVM) Algorithms and developed models are evaluated by Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
Two models with SVM are developed for Ultimate Tensile Strength(UTS) and Fatigue Strength prediction.
39 alloys with temper gread as fabricated are taken to develop the models.
